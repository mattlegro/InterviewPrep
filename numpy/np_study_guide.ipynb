    "NumPy is an open-source, high-performing library that allows complex mathematical and scientific computational capabilities. It makes use of Python language which is a high-level, easy-to-learn, general-purpose programming language. NumPy supports the operations on arrays of homogenous data so that it can take advantage of C optimized backend code (C requiring set, homogenous data types). This makes Python act as a really advanced programming language that manipulates numerical data. It increases the functionality and operability of NumPy. It supports the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Powerful functions for performing complex mathematical operations on multi-dimensional matrices and arrays. The operations on ndarrays of NumPy are approximately up to 50% faster when compared to operations on native lists using loops. This efficiency is very much useful \n",
    "\n",
    "-when the arrays have millions of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Provides indexing syntax to access portions of data easily in a large array.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Provides built-in functions which help to easily perform operations related to linear algebra and statistics.\n",

    "-It takes only a few lines of code to achieve complex computations using NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy compared to Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "-Python lists support storing heterogeneous data types whereas NumPy arrays can store datatypes of one nature itself. NumPy provides extra functional capabilities that make operating on its arrays easier which makes NumPy array advantageous in comparison to Python lists as those functions cannot be operated on heterogeneous data.\n",
    "\n",
    "-NumPy arrays are treated as objects which results in minimal memory usage. Since Python keeps track of objects by creating or deleting them based on the requirements, NumPy objects are also treated the same way. This results in lesser memory wastage.\n",
    "\n",
    "-NumPy arrays support multi-dimensional arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "-NumPy provides various powerful and efficient functions for complex computations on the arrays.\n",

    "\n",
    "ndarray object is the core of the NumPy package. It consists of n-dimensional arrays storing elements of the same data types and also has many operations that are done in compiled code for optimised performance. These arrays have fixed sizes defined at the time of creation. Following are some of the properties of ndarrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "-When the size of ndarrays is changed, it results in a new array and the original array is deleted.\n",

    "Vectorization involves delegating NumPy operations internally to optimized C language functions to result in faster Python code. Whereas Broadcasting refers to the methods that allow NumPy to perform array-related arithmetic operations. The size or shape of the arrays does not matter in this case. Broadcasting solves the problem of mismatched shaped arrays by replicating the smaller array along the larger array to ensure both arrays are having compatible shapes for NumPy operations. Performing Broadcasting before Vectorization helps to vectorize operations which support arrays of different dimensions.\n",
